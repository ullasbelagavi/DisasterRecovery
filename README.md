# DisasterRecovery
•	Developed the project to continuously check the health of Virtual Machines running on VMware ESXi hypervisor.
•	Designed the system to create the clone of Virtual Machines using snapshots in case of virtual machine failure and the system would migrate the cloned virtual machine to a  new host in case of host failure.
